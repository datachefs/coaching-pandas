Notes, links, IPython notebooks for coaching someone how to analyze data using pandas and IPython notebook

NOTE: for now, just dumping my notes and links right here; clean it up later.

## Installing, Getting Set up
Anaconda

Jupyter vs IPython

Getting IPython set up -- and down the line, figuring out how to launch stuff


## Basics

- Tutorial:  Data Carpentry Python for Ecologists: http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/
- Tutorial:  Julia Evans' Lessons/Cookbook:  https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/README.md
- My little pandas cookbook (a little out of date): http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aschneiderman/cookbook-notes/blob/master/cookbook/Pandas_4_Excel_Users.ipynb

The pandas documentation and how to read it: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

## Using Bokeh
http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/charts.html#userguide-charts

To display Bokeh plots inline in an Jupyter notebook, use the output_notebook() function from bokeh.io instead of (or in addition to) the output_file() function we have seen previously. No other modifications are required.
As a convenience, output_notebook() is also importable from the bokeh.charts and bokeh.plotting modules

Homework: grid plots and other layouts (aka something you can’t do in Excel w/o a lot of copy paste):
