# coaching-pandas
Notes, links, IPython notebooks for coaching someone how to analyze data using pandas and IPython notebook; quick-and-dirty dump of notes + links using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables) formatting.

## Installing, Getting Set up
Needs links to:
- Anaconda
- Jupyter vs IPython
- Getting IPython set up -- and down the line, figuring out how to launch stuff


## Pandas Basics
- Tutorial:  Data Carpentry Python for Ecologists: http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/
- Tutorial:  Julia Evans' Lessons/Cookbook:  https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/README.md
- My little pandas cookbook (a little out of date): http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aschneiderman/cookbook-notes/blob/master/cookbook/Pandas_4_Excel_Users.ipynb
- The pandas documentation and how to read it: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/
- Tom Augspurger's Modern Pandas:  http://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1.html  (plus a talk by Tom:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCriSKVV_8&feature=youtu.be)

## The Tricky Bits
Need links for:
- What if my data has funny characters in it (common when pulling data from a Microsoft environment)
- Fixing dates -- especially when dealing with data from Excel
- How to work with large JSON datasets using Python and Pandas: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/using-json-data-in-pandas/
- How to read error messages

## Really Pretty Data Visualization:  Bokeh
- http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/charts.html#userguide-charts
- Getting it to work in Jupyter:  "to display Bokeh plots inline in an Jupyter notebook, use the output_notebook() function from bokeh.io instead of (or in addition to) the output_file() function we have seen previously. No other modifications are required.  As a convenience, output_notebook() is also importable from the bokeh.charts and bokeh.plotting modules"
- Homework: grid plots and other layouts (aka something you canâ€™t do in Excel w/o a lot of copy paste): http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.11.0/docs/user_guide/layout.html

## Using IPython Notebook for Slides and presentations
- Turning An IPython Notebook into a Slideshow  http://jupyter.cs.brynmawr.edu/hub/dblank/public/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb#6.-Turning-Your-Jupyter-Notebook-into-a-Slideshow
- How to make polished Jupyter presentations with optional code visibility  http://chris-said.io/2016/02/13/how-to-make-polished-jupyter-presentations-with-optional-code-visibility/

## Working With Other Systems such as Salesforce
- Salesforce: [pullling Salesforce data](https://plot.ly/python/salesforce/), [loading data](https://medium.com/@AnnaCrotty2/using-pandas-and-python-to-import-data-into-salesforce-118f39cd718b#.4n97tzgkk) into Salesforce, bulk updating records](http://www.wadewegner.com/2014/04/update-records-with-python-and-the-salesforce-bulk-api/) (uses the [Bulk API](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F0000000MH43IAG))


## A Few Tutorials on Fancier Analysis
-Payout sensitivity to performance using IPython - Incentius: http://incentius.com/blog-posts/ipython-sensitivity-of-payout-to-sales-performance/
- An interview with "Box Plots for Education" winner Quoc Le (data sci at Salesforce): http://blog.drivendata.org/2015/02/26/box-plots-winner-interview-quoc-le/


## Building Sustainable Infrastructure
- Building Code/Processes That Degrade Gracefully


## Building your Voice
-  Links for Creating a GitHub account
- Building a rep:  for ex, If documentation is lousy, if not enough examples, easy way to get involved -- same thing for creating beginning tutorials
