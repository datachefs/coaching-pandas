Notes, links, IPython notebooks for coaching someone how to analyze data using pandas and IPython notebook


My quick and dirty notes/links dump:



Jypter vs IPython
Getting IPython set up (homework down the line:  figuring out best way to launch stuff)

Reading in a file

How to do calculations
how to recode something
How to find the pandas documentation – and how to read it


Using Bokeh
http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/charts.html#userguide-charts
To display Bokeh plots inline in an Jupyter notebook, use the output_notebook() function from bokeh.io instead of (or in addition to) the output_file() function we have seen previously. No other modifications are required.
Note
As a convenience, output_notebook() is also importable from the bokeh.charts and bokeh.plotting modules


Homework: grid plots and other layouts (aka something you can’t do in Excel w/o a lot of copy paste)
http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.11.0/docs/user_guide/layout.html
